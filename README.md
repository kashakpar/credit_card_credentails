# Credit Card Validator (Luhn Algorithm)

This is a simple web-based project that validates credit card numbers using the "Luhn Algorithm".

## Features
- User-friendly form to enter Name and Card Number  
- Validates card numbers instantly (no backend required)  
- Displays results in green (valid) or red (invalid)  
- Built with "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"  

## How It Works
The Luhn Algorithm (a checksum formula) is applied to the entered card number. If the number passes the check, itâ€™s marked as **valid**, otherwise as **invalid**.
